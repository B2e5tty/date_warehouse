# Building Data Warehouse
Business Need

As a data engineer at a leading data science company with over 50+ data-centric solutions, I am tasked with building a data warehouse to store data on Ethiopian medical businesses scrapped from the web and telegram channels. This project involves several key steps and considerations to ensure the data warehouse is robust, scalable, and capable of handling the unique challenges associated with scraping and data collection from Telegram channels. Additionally, it involves integrating object detection capabilities using YOLO (You Only Look Once) to enhance data analysis. 

The job is to build a product that does the following 
- Develop data scraping and collection pipeline.
- Develop data cleaning and transformation pipeline.
- Object detection using YOLO.
- Data warehouse design and implementation
- Data integration and enrichment
